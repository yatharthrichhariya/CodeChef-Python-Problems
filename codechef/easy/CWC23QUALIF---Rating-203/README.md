## Problem

### Cricket World Cup Qualifier

The cricket World Cup has started in Chefland. There are many teams participating in the group stage matches. Any team that scores $12$ or more points in the group stage matches qualifies for the next stage.

### Input Format

### Output Format

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).
