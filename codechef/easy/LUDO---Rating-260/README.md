## Problem

### Chef Plays Ludo

Chef is playing Ludo. According to the rules of Ludo, a player can enter a new token into the play only when he rolls a $6$ on the die.

In the current turn, Chef rolled the number $X$ on the die. Determine if Chef can enter a new token into the play in the current turn or not.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains one integer $X$ — the number rolled by the Chef on the die.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `YES` if the Chef can enter a new token in the game. Otherwise, output `NO`.

You may print each character of `YES` and `NO` in uppercase or lowercase (for example, `yes`, `yEs`, `Yes` will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 6$
- $1 \le X \le 6$
### Sample 1:

Output

```
3
1
6
3

```

```
NO
YES
NO

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  Since Chef did not roll a $6$, he can not enter a new token in the play.

 **Test Case 2:**  Since Chef rolled a $6$, he can enter a new token in the play.
