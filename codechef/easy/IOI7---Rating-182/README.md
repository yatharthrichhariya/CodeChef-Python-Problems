## Problem

### IOI Gold

Chef recently participated in the IOI competition, and scored $N$ points out of $600$ on the $2$ days of competition.

Just now, the gold cutoff was released, which was $G$ points, meaning everyone with at least $G$ points gets a gold medal. Chef wants to know if he will get gold or not. Print $\text{Yes}$ or $\text{No}$ accordingly.

Both $N$ and $G$ are integers.

### Input Format
- The first and only line contains $2$ integers - $N$ and $G$.
### Output Format

Output $\text{Yes}$ or $\text{No}$ depending on whether Chef gets a gold medal or not.

### Constraints
- $0 \le N, G \le 600$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
498 361

```

```
Yes
```

### Explanation:

Chef scored $498$ points while the gold cutoff was $361$ points, so he easily clears the cutoff. One might even think he could win the IOI.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
300 361

```

```
No
```

### Explanation:

Chef scored $300$ points while the cutoff was $361$, hence he failed to get a gold.
