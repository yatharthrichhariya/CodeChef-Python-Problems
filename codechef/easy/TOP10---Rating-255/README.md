## Problem

### Masterchef finals

Chef has been working hard to compete in MasterChef.
He is ranked $X$ out of all contestants. However, only $10$ contestants would be selected for the finals.

Check whether Chef made it to the top $10$ or not?

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of one integers $X$ — the current rank of Chef.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, `YES`, if Chef made it to the top $10$ and `NO` otherwise.

Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. That is, the strings `NO`, `no`, `nO`, and `No` will be treated as equivalent.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
15
10
1
50
```

```
NO
YES
YES
NO
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef's rank is $15$ which is greater than $10$. Thus, Chef did not make it to the top $10$.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef's rank is $10$ which is equal to $10$. Thus, Chef made it to the top $10$.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef made it to the top $10$, as his rank is $1$.

 **Test case $4$:**  Chef did not make it to the top $10$ as his rank is $50$.

for i in range(T):
    X=int(input())
    if X <=10:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
```
