## Problem

### Get Subscription

Chef wants to conduct a lecture for which he needs to set up an online meeting of exactly $X$ minutes.

The meeting platform supports a meeting of maximum $30$ minutes without subscription and a meeting of unlimited duration with subscription.

Determine whether Chef needs to take a subscription or not for setting up the meet.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains a single integer $X$ - denoting the duration of the lecture.
### Output Format

For each test case, print in a single line, `YES` if Chef needs to take the subscription, otherwise print `NO`.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `YES`, `yEs`, `yes`, and `yeS` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
50
3
30
80

```

```
YES
NO
NO
YES

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  Without subscription, the platform allows only $30$ minutes of duration. Since Chef needs to conduct a lecture of $50$ minutes, he needs to buy the subscription.

 **Test Case $2$:**  Without subscription, the platform allows $30$ minutes of duration. Since Chef needs to conduct a lecture of $3$ minutes only, he does not need to buy the subscription.

 **Test Case $3$:**  Without subscription, the platform allows $30$ minutes of duration. Since Chef needs to conduct a lecture of $30$ minutes only, he does not need to buy the subscription.

 **Test Case $4$:**  Without subscription, the platform allows only $30$ minutes of duration. Since Chef needs to conduct a lecture of $80$ minutes, he needs to buy the subscription.
