## Problem

### Possible Roll

Nikhil is playing a board game with a wizard who uses a custom, magically forged $X$-sided die.

Unlike normal dice, this die has a "base multiplier" $K$. The faces of the die are not numbered $1, 2, 3 \dots X$. Instead, they are numbered with the first $X$ positive multiples of $K$.

For example, if the die has $4$ sides and the base multiplier is $3$, the faces are numbered $3, 6, 9$, and $12$.

The wizard rolls the die behind a screen and claims the result is $Y$. Given $X$, $K$, and $Y$, determine if it is mathematically possible for this die to show the number $Y$.

### Input Format
- The only line of input contains three space-separated integers $X$, $K$, and $Y$, denoting the number of sides on the die, the base multiplier, and the wizard's claimed result, respectively.
### Output Format

Output "YES" (without quotes) if it is mathematically possible for the die to show $Y$, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase).

### Constraints
- $1 \le X \le 10$
- $1 \le K \le 10$
- $1 \le Y \le 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
6 5 20

```

```
YES

```

### Explanation:

The die has $6$ faces, numbered $5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30$. Since $20$ is one of these faces, the die can show $20$.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
4 3 15

```

```
NO

```

### Explanation:

The die has $4$ faces, numbered $3, 6, 9, 12$. Since $15$ is not one of these faces, the die cannot show $15$.

```py

X, K, Y = map(int, input().split())
if Y % K == 0 and Y // K <= X:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```
