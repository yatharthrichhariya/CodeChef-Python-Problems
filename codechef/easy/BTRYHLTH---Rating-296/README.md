## Problem

### Battery Health

Apple considers any iPhone with a battery health of $80\%$ or above, to be in  *optimal*  condition.

Given that your iPhone has $X\%$ battery health, find whether it is in  *optimal*  condition.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of each test case contains an integer $X$ — the battery health.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, `YES`, if the battery is in  *optimal*  condition, and `NO` otherwise.

You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, `NO`, `no`, `No` and `nO`, are all considered identical.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $0 \leq X \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
97
42
80
10

```

```
YES
NO
YES
NO

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The battery health is $97 \%$ which is greater than equal to $80 \%$. Thus, the battery is in optimal condition.

 **Test case $2$:**  The battery health is $42 \%$ which is less than $80 \%$. Thus, the battery is not in optimal condition.

 **Test case $3$:**  The battery health is $80 \%$ which is greater than equal to $80 \%$. Thus, the battery is in optimal condition.

 **Test case $4$:**  The battery health is $10 \%$ which is less than $80 \%$. Thus, the battery is not in optimal condition.

```py
T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    X=int(input())
    if X>=80:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
```
