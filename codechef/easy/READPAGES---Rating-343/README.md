## Problem

### Read Pages

Chef has started studying for the upcoming test. The textbook has $N$ pages in total. Chef wants to read at most $X$ pages a day for $Y$ days.

Find out whether it is possible for Chef to complete the whole book.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N, X,$ and $Y$ — the number of pages, the number of pages Chef can read in a day, and the number of days.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, `YES`, if Chef can complete the whole book in given time, and `NO` otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase. For example, `Yes`, `YES`, `yes`, and `yES` are all considered identical.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X, Y \leq 10$
### Sample 1:

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef cannot complete all ten pages in three days.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef can read all seven pages in one day.

for i in range(T):
    N,X,Y=map(int,input().split())
    if X*Y>=N:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
```
