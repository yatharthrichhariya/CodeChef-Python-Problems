## Problem

### Overspeeding Fine

Chef was driving on a highway at a speed of $X$ km/hour.

To avoid accidents, there are fine imposed on overspeeding as follows:

- No fine if the speed of the car $\leq 70$ km/hour.
- Rs $500$ fine if the speed of the car is strictly greater than $70$ and $\leq 100$.
- Rs $2000$ fine if the speed of the car is strictly greater than $100$.

Determine the fine Chef needs to pay.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single integer $X$ denoting the speed of Chef's car.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the fine paid by Chef.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 200$
- $1 \leq X \leq 200$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
7
40
110
70
100
69
101
85

```

```
0
2000
0
500
0
2000
500

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The speed is $\leq 70$. Thus, Chef does not need to pay any fine.

 **Test case $2$:**  The speed is greater than $100$. Thus, Chef needs to pay $2000$ as fine.

 **Test case $3$:**  The speed is $\leq 70$. Thus, Chef does not need to pay any fine.

 **Test case $4$:**  The speed is greater than $70$ and $\leq 100$. Thus, Chef needs to pay $500$ as fine amount.

 **Test case $5$:**  The speed is $\leq 70$. Thus, Chef does not need to pay any fine.

 **Test case $6$:**  The speed is greater than $100$. Thus, Chef needs to pay $2000$ as fine.

 **Test case $7$:**  The speed is greater than $70$ and $\leq 100$. Thus, Chef needs to pay $500$ as fine amount.

```py
T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    X=int(input())
    if X<=70:
        print("0")
    elif X>100:
        print("2000")
    else:
        print("500")
```
