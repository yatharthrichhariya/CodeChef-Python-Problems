## Problem

### Fitness

Chef wants to become fit for which he decided to walk to the office and return home by walking. It is known that Chef's office is $X$ km away from his home.

If his office is open on $5$ days in a week, find the number of kilometers Chef travels through office trips in a week.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains of a single line consisting of single integer $X$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the number of kilometers Chef travels through office trips in a week.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq X \leq 10$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
1
3
7
10

```

```
10
30
70
100

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The office is $1$ km away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk $2$ kms in a day. In a week with $5$ working days, Chef has to travel $2\cdot 5 = 10$ kms in total.

 **Test case $2$:**  The office is $3$ kms away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk $6$ kms in a day. In a week with $5$ working days, Chef has to travel $6\cdot 5 = 30$ kms in total.

 **Test case $3$:**  The office is $7$ kms away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk $14$ kms in a day. In a week with $5$ working days, Chef has to travel $14\cdot 5 = 70$ kms in total.

 **Test case $4$:**  The office is $10$ kms away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk $20$ kms in a day. In a week with $5$ working days, Chef has to travel $20\cdot 5 = 100$ kms in total.

```py
t = int(input())

while t > 0:
    x = int(input())
    t -= 1
    a=x*2
    print(a*5)
```
