## Problem

### Kitchen Timings

The working hours of Chef’s kitchen are from $X$ pm to $Y$ pm $(1 \le X \lt Y \le 12)$.

Find the number of hours Chef works.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two space-separated integers $X$ and $Y$ — the starting and ending time of working hours respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, the number of hours Chef works.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X \lt Y \leq 12$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
1 2
3 7
9 11
2 10

```

```

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef starts working at $1$ pm and works till $2$ pm. Thus, he works for $1$ hour.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef starts working at $3$ pm and works till $7$ pm. Thus, he works for $4$ hours.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef starts working at $9$ pm and works till $11$ pm. Thus, he works for $2$ hours.

 **Test case $4$:**  Chef starts working at $2$ pm and works till $10$ pm. Thus, he works for $8$ hours.
