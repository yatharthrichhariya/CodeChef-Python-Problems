## Problem

### Chess Time

Chef has recently started playing chess, and wants to play as many games as possible.

He calculated that playing one game of chess takes at least $20$ minutes of his time.

Chef has $N$  **hours**  of free time. What is the maximum number of  **complete**  chess games he can play in that time?

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single line containing a single integer, $N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of complete chess games Chef can play in $N$ hours.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
1
10

3

```

```
3
30
21

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  If every game Chef plays takes $20$ minutes, he can play $3$ games in one hour.

 **Test case $2$:**  If every game Chef plays takes $20$ minutes, he can play $30$ games in $10$ hours.

 **Test case $3$:**  If every game Chef plays takes $20$ minutes, he can play $21$ games in $7$ hours.
