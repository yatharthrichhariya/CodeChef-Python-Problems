## Problem

### Candy Division

There are  **three**  friends and a total of $N$ candies.
There will be a fight amongst the friends if all of them do  **not**  get the same number of candies.

Chef wants to divide  **all**  the candies such that there is  **no fight**. Find whether such distribution is possible.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of a single integer $N$ - the number of candies.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `YES`, if we can distribute all the candies between the three friends equally. Otherwise output `NO`.

You can output each character of the answer in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings `yEs`, `yes`, `Yes`, and YES are considered the same.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
3
4
2
6

```

```
YES
NO
NO
YES
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef can distribute all $3$ candies such that each friend gets $1$ candy. Since all three friends have same number of candies, there is no fight.

 **Test case $2$:**  There exist no way of distributing  **all**  candies such that all three friends have same number of candies.

 **Test case $3$:**  There exist no way of distributing  **all**  candies such that all three friends have same number of candies.

 **Test case $4$:**  Chef can distribute all $6$ candies such that each friend gets $2$ candies. Since all three friends have same number of candies, there is no fight.
